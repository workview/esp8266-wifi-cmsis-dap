This is a port of the core of ARM's CMSIS-DAP firmware to the Arduino environment,
which lets you turn a <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12587">Pro Micro</a> (or $3.50 clone from China)
or <a href="https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html">Teensy 3.2</a> into a
CMSIS-DAP USB adapter, which you can use with OpenOCD and mbed to program and debug ARM chips using the SWD protocol,
and also with OpenOCD to program and debug various chips using JTAG.
